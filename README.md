# Pi'gredients

This is a forked version of rasathus/pigredients

This version has modified ws2801.py code to run with Python3. /pigredients/ics/ws2801.py
has been designed to work with quick2wire-python's SPI interface for use with Python3

Additionally luminescence functionality has been added back in, even though it may cause flicker.
